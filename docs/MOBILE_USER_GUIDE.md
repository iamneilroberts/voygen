## Mobile Tips

AI: [Shows Paris trips]
You: "Publish the first one"  
AI: [Publishes the first Paris trip from previous response]
```

### **Offline Usage**
- Interface works offline for viewing recent conversations
- New requests require internet connection
- Quick actions cache for faster loading

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **"Authentication failed"**
- Check your token is exactly: `dev-secret`
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Make sure you're using HTTPS

#### **"Server error" in responses**
- Usually temporary - try your request again
- Check your internet connection
- Contact support if persistent

#### **Slow responses**
- Complex queries take 5-10 seconds
- Typing indicator shows the AI is working
- Use Quick Actions for faster responses

#### **"No trips found"**
- Try broader search terms
- Use client email instead of name
- Check spelling of trip names

### Getting Better Results

#### **Be Specific**
‚ùå "Show me stuff"
‚úÖ "Show me trips for John Smith"

#### **Include Context**  
‚ùå "Update it"
‚úÖ "Update the Paris trip status to confirmed"

#### **Use Names & IDs**
‚ùå "That one"
‚úÖ "Trip 123" or "Paris Getaway"
