# TravelOps.ai

**LLM-Agnostic AI Travel Planning Platform**

TravelOps.ai is a professional travel planning system built on Continue.dev with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, designed to provide travel agents with a flexible, multi-model AI assistant that can switch between different LLMs for optimal cost and performance.

## 🎯 Vision

Create the world's first truly LLM-agnostic professional travel planning platform that gives travel agents the power to:
- Switch between AI models based on task complexity and cost requirements
- Maintain consistent workflow across different AI providers
- Scale commercially with flexible pricing models
- Integrate with existing travel industry tools and databases

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Model Support**: Seamlessly switch between Claude Haiku 3.5, Sonnet, GPT-4, Gemini, and local models
- **Cost Optimization**: Use cheaper models for routine tasks, premium models for complex planning
- **Professional Interface**: Travel agent-focused UI with itinerary management, cost tracking, and document generation
- **MCP Integration**: Compatible with existing 12-server MCP architecture from Claude Travel Agent
- **Workflow Management**: Structured 12-step travel planning process with state persistence
- **Enterprise Security**: Secure credential management and access controls

## 🏗️ Architecture

Built on top of Continue.dev's LLM-agnostic framework with:
- **Core Engine**: Continue.dev MCP client with custom travel agent extensions
- **Model Abstraction Layer**: Unified interface for multiple AI providers
- **Professional UI**: Custom React/Vue.js interface for travel professionals
- **MCP Server Integration**: Direct compatibility with existing travel planning tools
- **Database Layer**: Cost tracking, workflow state, and client management
