Repo cache: .cache-voygent-hosted/

Summary
- Goal: Get Render build green for LibreChat + MCP under voygent-hosted.
- Blocker: LibreChat monorepo rollup step fails in packages/data-provider with “Cannot find module 'rollup-plugin-typescript2'”.
- Latest failing deploy: dep-d390ocidbo4c73bp57s0 at 2025-09-23 02:57:25Z.

What’s been fixed already
- CONFIG_PATH corrected to /opt/render/project/src/librechat/librechat.yaml in .cache-voygent-hosted/render.yaml.
- Client build dependencies present: @vitejs/plugin-react + vite installed at client-level; removed root-level vite to avoid ERESOLVE.
- UI patch runs cleanly during build: StatusBar and footer branding logs appear.

Persistent issue
- During LibreChat frontend build (npm run frontend), rollup for packages/data-provider executes a generated config (rollup.config-*.cjs) that requires rollup-plugin-typescript2. Node cannot resolve it:
  Error: Cannot find module 'rollup-plugin-typescript2'
  Require stack includes /opt/render/project/src/librechat/packages/data-provider/rollup.config-<timestamp>.cjs

Attempts made
1) Installed @vitejs/plugin-react + vite at client; resolved initial vite plugin error.
2) Removed global rimraf and avoided root-level vite installs (ERESOLVE conflict); resolved dependency clash.
3) Added rollup + plugin devDeps at LibreChat root and attempted targeted installs of rollup-plugin-typescript2 inside packages/data-provider and data-schemas. Still seeing MODULE_NOT_FOUND in Render logs.
4) Attempted to switch rollup configs to use @rollup/plugin-typescript instead of rollup-plugin-typescript2 via .cache-voygent-hosted/scripts/patch-librechat-ui.js, but the guard logic prevented the replacement, so configs likely remained unchanged.
5) Removed require.resolve verification snippets that inadvertently caused a deliberate crash path when not present.

Root cause hypothesis
- Upstream LibreChat packages’ rollup configs (packages/data-provider and packages/data-schemas) require rollup-plugin-typescript2. Even after installing at various levels during the ephemeral build, require resolution is failing in the package working directory. The safer approach is to patch these rollup configs to use @rollup/plugin-typescript (which is already installed) instead of rollup-plugin-typescript2.

Recommended next action (surgical)
- Force patch the upstream rollup configs before monorepo build:
  Targets:
  - librechat/packages/data-provider/rollup.config.ts
  - librechat/packages/data-schemas/rollup.config.ts
  Replace both ESM import and CJS require of 'rollup-plugin-typescript2' with '@rollup/plugin-typescript'.
  Ensure the patch runs unconditionally and logs a message like:
  [voygent patch] Updated rollup config to use @rollup/plugin-typescript: <path>

If patching configs is undesirable
- Add devDependencies for rollup-plugin-typescript2 explicitly in each package:
  - librechat/packages/data-provider/package.json
  - librechat/packages/data-schemas/package.json
  Then run npm i -D in those package directories before running npm run frontend.

Recent commits related to deploy fixes
- e1d8e03: fix(render): correct CONFIG_PATH; remove global rimraf
- b2bcb9d/e3822c2/6a9aa75/5d74d6c: build tweaks for vite and rollup deps
- ac26fae: attempted rollup config migration to @rollup/plugin-typescript (but logic didn’t apply)
- 8fb0167: removed verification steps to avoid induced failure

Next steps for the next agent
1) Update patch-librechat-ui.js to unconditionally replace rollup-plugin-typescript2 with @rollup/plugin-typescript in the two rollup.config.ts files and log confirmation.
2) Redeploy and verify logs show the patch messages; then confirm data-provider build proceeds.
3) If needed, add package-local devDependencies for rollup-plugin-typescript2 instead and rebuild.
