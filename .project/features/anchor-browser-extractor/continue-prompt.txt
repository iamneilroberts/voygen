 Continuation Prompt for MCP Anchor Browser Implementation

  Project Context

  You are continuing work on implementing TASK-0055: Anchor Browser MCP 
  Foundation - a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with
  Anchor Browser API for autonomous travel data extraction within the
  Voygen travel assistant system.

  Current Status - Implementation COMPLETED ✅

  The foundational infrastructure has been successfully implemented and is
  ready for testing and deployment. Here's what has been completed:

  ✅ Completed Work

  1. Project Structure: Complete directory structure created at
  remote-mcp-servers/mcp-anchor-browser/
  2. Configuration:
    - package.json with all dependencies
    - tsconfig.json configured for Cloudflare Workers
    - wrangler.toml configured with D1 database and KV storage
  3. Core Implementation:
    - Environment types (src/types/env.ts)
    - Anchor Browser API types (src/types/anchor.ts)
    - Logging utilities (src/utils/logger.ts)
    - Error handling (src/utils/errors.ts)
    - Anchor Browser client (src/clients/anchor-browser.ts)
    - MCP server implementation (src/mcp/server.ts)
    - Main worker entry point (src/index.ts)
    - Configuration constants (src/config/constants.ts)
    - Comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
  4. Build System: TypeScript compilation working correctly

  API Key Available

  - ANCHOR_API_KEY: sk-869a7453132be343c19f3a560aff1359

  Current Issue to Resolve

  The last attempt to start wrangler dev failed due to system file watcher
  limits (ENOSPC errors). This is a system configuration issue, not a code
  issue.

  Next Steps Needed

  1. Immediate Testing (Priority: High)

  - Test Anchor Browser API connectivity with the provided API key
  - Verify the actual API endpoints (the /health endpoint returned 404,
  suggesting different API structure)
  - Start wrangler dev server successfully (may need --no-bundle flag to
  avoid file watcher issues)
  - Test basic MCP server endpoints (/health, /sse, /metrics)

  2. MCP Protocol Integration (Priority: High)

  - Test the MCP Server-Sent Events endpoint
  - Verify MCP tool registration and execution
  - Test basic tools like test_anchor_connection and get_server_status
  - Integrate with LibreChat configuration

  3. Anchor Browser API Integration (Priority: Medium)

  - Research actual Anchor Browser API documentation
  - Update API client based on real API structure
  - Test session creation, navigation, and data extraction
  - Validate cost tracking and budget management

  4. Deployment Preparation (Priority: Medium)

  - Set up Cloudflare secrets for production
  - Test deployment to Cloudflare Workers
  - Configure KV namespaces and D1 database
  - Set up monitoring and health checks

  Key Files to Focus On

  - Main entry point: src/index.ts - Worker application with health checks
  - MCP server: src/mcp/server.ts - 12 MCP tools implemented
  - Anchor client: src/clients/anchor-browser.ts - API integration layer
  - Configuration: wrangler.toml - May need KV namespace IDs updated

  Available MCP Tools (Already Implemented)

  1. test_anchor_connection - Test API connectivity
  2. get_server_status - Server metrics and status
  3. create_session - Create browser session
  4. navigate - Navigate to URLs
  5. screenshot - Capture screenshots
  6. extract_data - Extract structured data
  7. click_element - Click page elements
  8. type_text - Type into input fields
  9. wait_for_element - Wait for elements
  10. get_session_metrics - Session statistics
  11. close_session - Close browser session
  12. get_budget_status - Budget and cost tracking

  Technical Notes

  - Environment:
  /home/neil/dev/voygen/remote-mcp-servers/mcp-anchor-browser/
  - Dependencies: All installed, TypeScript builds successfully
  - Architecture: Cloudflare Workers + Hono + MCP SDK + Anchor Browser API
  - Database: D1 database configured (travel_assistant)
  - Caching: KV storage configured for session/metrics caching

  Commands to Start With

  # Navigate to project
  cd /home/neil/dev/voygen/remote-mcp-servers/mcp-anchor-browser

  # Test Anchor API connectivity
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-869a7453132be343c19f3a560aff1359"
  https://api.anchorbrowser.io/v1/status

  # Start dev server (try different approaches)
  ANCHOR_API_KEY=sk-869a7453132be343c19f3a560aff1359 wrangler dev
  --no-bundle
  # OR
  ANCHOR_API_KEY=sk-869a7453132be343c19f3a560aff1359 wrangler dev
  --compatibility-date=2024-01-01

  # Test health endpoint
  curl http://localhost:8787/health

  Success Criteria for Next Session

  - Anchor Browser API connection working
  - Wrangler dev server running without errors
  - Health endpoint returning 200 OK
  - MCP SSE endpoint accessible
  - At least one MCP tool executable (test_anchor_connection)
  - Ready for LibreChat integration testing

  Context Files to Review

  - README.md - Complete setup and usage documentation
  - src/mcp/server.ts - MCP tool implementations
  - src/clients/anchor-browser.ts - API client logic
  - wrangler.toml - Cloudflare Workers configuration

  The foundation is solid and complete - focus on testing, debugging API
  connectivity, and preparing for deployment. This represents significant
  progress toward autonomous travel data extraction capabilities for the
  Voygen system.
