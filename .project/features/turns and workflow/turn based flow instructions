5) Basic “turn instructions” (orchestrator) for your POC

Keep it simple—intents, then fallbacks:

Intent tools (HTTP endpoints you own):

trips.search_by_city_dates_budget → SQL template on Neon

ingest.hotels, ingest.rooms → writes caches + materializes trip_facts

facts.query → GIN/JSONPath limited search over trip_facts

Claude prompt (your system) says:

Prefer intent tools;

else use facts.query;

else respond with a short “capability gap” message.

You can start with just /api/orchestrator/chat and stub the others with mock JSON to prove wiring.
