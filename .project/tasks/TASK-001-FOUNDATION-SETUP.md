# Task: Foundation Setup and Environment Configuration

**ID**: TASK-001  
**Type**: foundation  
**Status**: in_progress  
**Priority**: critical  
**Assignee**: Lead Developer

### Development Environment
```dockerfile
# Development Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Install Continue.dev CLI
RUN npm install -g @continue/cli

# Copy project files
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

# Expose development ports
EXPOSE 3000 8080

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Continue.dev Installation (Days 1-2)
1. Install Continue.dev CLI and extensions
2. Create initial configuration file
3. Test basic model connectivity
4. Verify MCP protocol support
5. Document installation process

### Phase 2: MCP Server Testing (Days 3-7)
1. Test each existing MCP server individually
2. Verify tool calling functionality
3. Test concurrent server usage
4. Monitor performance and reliability
5. Create compatibility documentation

### Phase 3: Model Integration (Days 8-12)
1. Configure multiple model providers
2. Test model switching functionality
3. Implement cost tracking basics
4. Test failover scenarios
5. Create model selection documentation

### Phase 4: Development Workflow (Days 13-21)
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline
2. Create development scripts
3. Configure testing framework
4. Set up monitoring and logging
5. Document complete workflow

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Continue.dev Basic Functionality
- **Test**: Install Continue.dev and verify operation
- **Expected**: Successful installation and basic chat functionality
- **Validation**: Create simple queries and verify responses

### 2. Model Provider Integration
- **Test**: Switch between Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google models
- **Expected**: Seamless model switching with maintained context
- **Validation**: Same query to different models, verify responses

### 3. MCP Server Connectivity
- **Test**: Connect to all existing MCP servers
- **Expected**: All servers respond to health checks and basic tool calls
- **Validation**: Successfully call at least one tool from each server

### 4. Cost Tracking

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Continue.dev Learning Curve**: Mitigation: Allocate extra time for learning and documentation
2. **MCP Compatibility Issues**: Mitigation: Test each server thoroughly, create workarounds
3. **Model Provider API Changes**: Mitigation: Use abstraction layer, monitor for changes
4. **Development Environment Complexity**: Mitigation: Use Docker for consistency

### Medium Risks
1. **Cost Overruns During Testing**: Mitigation: Set up monitoring and limits early
2. **Performance Issues**: Mitigation: Monitor and optimize during setup
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Mitigation: Follow security best practices from start

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Setup Time**: Complete setup in < 3 weeks
- **MCP Compatibility**: 100% of existing servers working
- **Model Response Time**: < 5 seconds for all providers
- **Error Rate**: < 1% for development operations
- **Test Coverage**: > 80% for core functionality

### Quality Metrics
- **Documentation Completeness**: All setup steps documented
- **Reproducibility**: New developer can set up environment in < 4 hours
- **Reliability**: Development environment stable for 99%+ of time
- **Security**: No secrets or credentials in version control

## Deliverables

### Week 1
- ✅ Project repository and structure
- ✅ Initial documentation
- [ ] Continue.dev installation guide
- [ ] Basic development environment

### Week 2  
- [ ] MCP server compatibility report

## Next Tasks

This task enables:
- **TASK-002**: UI/UX Design and Prototyping
- **TASK-003**: Model Abstraction Layer Development
- **TASK-004**: Professional Interface Implementation
- **TASK-005**: Cost Optimization System

## Notes

- Continue.dev is relatively new, expect some learning curve
- MCP protocol is evolving, monitor for updates
- Cost tracking is critical for business model validation
- Document everything for future team members
- Security should be built in from the start, not added later
