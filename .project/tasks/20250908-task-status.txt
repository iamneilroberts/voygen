  IMPLEMENTED
  - TASK-0050: Anchor Browser MCP Infrastructure - Status: âœ… COMPLETED
  (mcp-anchor-browser deployed)
  - TASK-0055: Anchor MCP Foundation - Status: âœ… COMPLETED

  Duplicate/Overlapping Tasks Identified

  ðŸ”´ Major Duplicates:

  1. Browser Automation Systems:
    - TASK-0033 (Chrome MCP Extraction)
    - TASK-0048 (MCP Chrome Web Extraction System)
    - TASK-0050 (Anchor Browser Infrastructure)
    - Resolution: Consolidate into Anchor Browser approach (TASK-0050
  completed)
  2. Commission Engine:
    - TASK-0034 (Commission Optimization Engine)
    - Commission tools in TASK-0032 (MCP Server Tools)
    - Resolution: TASK-0032 tools implemented, TASK-0034 should extend them
  3. Template System Overlap:
    - TASK-0035 (Template Rendering)
    - TASK-0041-0047 (Proposal Remix Series)
    - Resolution: TASK-0035 provides foundation, 0041-0047 adds advanced
  features

  Implementation Status Verification

  âœ… Confirmed Completed Tasks:

  1. TASK-0031 - Database Schema Migration (6/6 migrations applied)
  2. TASK-0032 - MCP Server Tools (9 tools implemented and deployed)
  3. TASK-0040 - Publishing Integration (GitHub MCP working)
  4. TASK-0050 - Anchor Browser Infrastructure (MCP server deployed)

  ðŸ”„ Partially Implemented:

  1. TASK-0034 - Commission Engine (tools exist but optimization logic
  incomplete)
  2. TASK-0035 - Template Rendering (basic system working, needs
  enhancement)
  3. TASK-0048 - Web Extraction (mcp-chrome exists but needs site-specific
  extractors)

  ðŸ“‹ Verification Plan:

  Database & Schema Verification

  # Verify migrations applied
  wrangler d1 execute travel_assistant --command "SELECT name FROM 
  sqlite_master WHERE type='table'"

  # Check schema version
  mcp__d1-database__health_check

  # Verify fact table system
  mcp__d1-database__get_facts_stats

  MCP Server Tool Verification

  # Test d1-database tools
  mcp__d1-database__explore_database

  # Test proposal generation
  mcp__d1-database__list_templates
  mcp__d1-database__preview_proposal

  # Test anchor browser connection
  mcp__mcp-anchor-browser__test_anchor_connection

  Template System Verification

  # Check template rendering capability
  cd remote-mcp-servers/d1-database-improved/src/render/
  ls -la *.ts

  # Test proposal generation with real data
  mcp__d1-database__generate_proposal

  Web Extraction Verification

  # Check mcp-chrome status
  cd mcp-local-servers/mcp-chrome-web-extract/
  ls -la app/

  # Test extraction capabilities
  mcp__mcp-chrome__chrome_extract_hotels

  Priority Action Items:

  High Priority (Complete These Next):

  1. Merge TASK-0041-0047 into a single Theme System Enhancement task (9-14
  hours total)
  2. Complete TASK-0034 Commission Optimization logic
  3. Finalize TASK-0048 Site-specific extractors for production use

  Medium Priority:

  1. TASK-0002 LibreChat Foundation (critical for user interface)
  2. Database Optimization - implement remaining migrations
  3. Error Resolution - fix db.prepare is not a function errors in proposal
  tools

  Low Priority/Consolidate:

  1. TASK-0033 can be REMOVED (superseded by TASK-0050)
  2. TASK-0036-0038 appear to be PLANNING DOCUMENTS rather than
  implementation tasks

  Recommended Next Steps:

  1. Fix Current Errors: Address the database connection issues in proposal
  tools
  2. Complete Template System: Merge tasks 0041-0047 into single
  implementation
  3. Production Deployment: Focus on tasks marked as "HIGH" priority
  4. Archive Completed: Move completed tasks (0031, 0032, 0040, 0050) to
  completed folder
  5. Consolidate Duplicates: Remove/merge overlapping browser automation
  tasks

  The project has strong foundational infrastructure completed (database,
  MCP servers, basic templates, publishing) and needs focused effort on 
  remaining template enhancements and web extraction capabilities to reach
  production readiness.
