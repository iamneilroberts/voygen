This is a **solid roadmap**—it’s exactly how you outflank something like Travefy: start lean, focus on high-pain workflows, and climb the value ladder with automation that competitors can’t easily bolt on. Let me break it down phase-by-phase with **product positioning, subscription packaging, and pricing strategy**.

---

# 🚀 Phase 1: Itineraries & Custom Website

**What it is:**

* “Travefy but actually smart.”
* AI-first itinerary builder (Claude/GPT-mini for cheap bulk work, Claude Opus or Sonnet for polish).
* Proposal rendering stack (Nunjucks → HTML → PDF).
* Client-facing shareable site with itinerary + booking CTAs.
* Agent dashboard (manage proposals, leads, pipeline).

**Target user:**
Solo or small agency travel advisors tired of copy/paste & clunky editors.

**Monetization models:**

* **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** Self-hosted, free or OSS. Attracts hobbyists, builds credibility/community. These users are *not* your paying customers anyway.
* **Hosted SaaS:** You arbitrage API costs. Run cheaper models for drafts (Haiku, GPT mini), let them pay for the polished outputs (Claude Sonnet, GPT-4).

**Pricing tiers suggestion:**

* **Starter** (\$29/mo): 10 itineraries/month, no white label, “Made with \[YourBrand]” footer.
* **Pro** (\$79/mo): Unlimited itineraries, white label, custom domain for client site.
* **Team** (\$199/mo): Multiple agents, shared dashboard, advanced templates, export to branded PDFs.

👉 This is *already* enough to beat Travefy for freelancers and small shops.

# ⚙️ Phase 2: Automated Search (CPMaxx / Vendors)

**What it is:**

* Browser automation (mcp-chrome or Opera Neon once stable) to **extract live availability** from CPMaxx, Navitrip, WAD, VAX, etc.
* AI merges availability + itinerary concepts → builds *realistic* proposals (no “fake hotels” problem).
* Agent dashboard gets a **structured search results cache** → filter, shortlist, commission-aware pricing.

**Target user:**
Mid-size agents / power users doing lots of Europe packages, who spend *hours* cross-checking availability.

**Value prop:**

* **Time saved:** 3–5 hours per proposal reduced to 15 minutes.
* **Accuracy:** No embarrassing “sorry it’s not actually available” moments.
* **Upsell commission optimization:** AI picks rooms with best revenue yield.

**Pricing:**

* **Pro+** (\$149/mo): Adds vendor integrations + search automation.
* **Agency** (\$399/mo): Multiple agents, priority search queue, SLA for automation uptime.

# 🏢 Phase 3: CPMaxx Back-End (Full CRM/Dashboard)

**What it is:**

* Browser automation fetches **reports** (payments, invoices, bookings) from CPMaxx.
* Synced with your proposal system → **one source of truth**.
* CRM-lite: client records, payments, commission reporting.
* Integrations: QuickBooks, HubSpot, Salesforce, Mailchimp.
* Agency dashboards: pipeline, revenue, agent performance.

**Target user:**
Full agencies with 5–50+ agents. Decision makers care about **back-office efficiency, reporting, and compliance**.

**Value prop:**

* Kill spreadsheets & manual reporting.
* Instant visibility into sales, commissions, payments.
* Lock agents into your ecosystem (high switching cost).

**Pricing:**

* **Agency Basic** (\$799/mo): Sync + dashboards for up to 10 agents.
* **Agency Plus** (\$1,499/mo): Unlimited agents, advanced CRM features, integrations.
* **Enterprise** (\$2,500+/mo): Custom automations, SLA support, priority feature requests.

# 🧭 Subscription & Market Strategy

1. **Phase 1** gets you a wedge—freelancers and side-hustle agents. Cheap, sticky, solves “Travefy but smarter.”
2. **Phase 2** is where the *serious money starts*: mid-tier agencies that pay to save hours on live availability.
3. **Phase 3** locks in the agencies—enterprise-level pricing justified by back-office automation, dashboards, and integrations.

**Key play:**

* Keep **BYOK OSS** version open → grows community, attracts contributors.
* Paid hosted version adds *convenience, integrations, uptime guarantees*.
* Phase 2 + 3 → High margin SaaS, where your arbitrage on models & automation saves them time *and* makes you money.

👉 Question for you: do you want me to mock up a **3-phase pricing page (like SaaS landing copy)** so you can see exactly how this could be presented to agents?
