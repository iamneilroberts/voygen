## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Ensure vitest is available
npm install -D vitest @vitest/coverage-v8
```

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test suite  
npm test proposal-remix-system

# Run integration tests only
npm test integration/

# Run in watch mode during development
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with verbose output
npm test -- --reporter=verbose
```

### Test Configuration

The test suite uses Vitest with the following configuration:

- **Environment**: Node.js
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds (for integration tests)
- **Coverage**: v8 provider with 80% minimum thresholds
- **Parallel**: Up to 4 threads for concurrent test execution
- **Globals**: Auto-imported test functions (describe, it, expect)

## Test Data and Mocks

### Mock Data Fixtures

The tests use comprehensive mock data representing:

- **Luxury Travel**: High-end hotels, premium tours, complex itineraries
- **Business Travel**: Executive accommodations, efficient layouts, minimal styling
- **Family Travel**: Kid-friendly amenities, family tours, group accommodations
- **Adventure Travel**: Activity-focused itineraries, modern styling

### Mock Services

- **MockDatabase**: In-memory storage for testing proposal persistence
- **Performance API**: Mock for timing measurements in test environments
- **Fetch API**: Mock for image processing and external resource loading
- **Buffer/Binary**: Compatibility mocks for Cloudflare Workers environment

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Thresholds

- **Global Coverage**: 80% lines, 75% functions, 70% branches
- **Proposal System**: 90% lines, 85% functions, 80% branches (higher standard)

### Excluded from Coverage

- Type definition files (*.d.ts)
- Test files themselves
- Node modules and build outputs

## Performance Testing

### Benchmarking

The integration tests include performance validation:

- **Generation Speed**: Sub-500ms proposal generation (TASK-0041 requirement)
- **Cache Efficiency**: Warm cache performance under 200ms
- **Concurrent Load**: Multiple proposals generated simultaneously
- **Memory Usage**: Template instance caching validation

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Run performance-focused tests
npm test -- --grep "Performance"

# Profile test execution
npm test -- --prof

# Memory usage analysis
npm test -- --heap-prof
```

## Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Development

1. **Red**: Write failing test for new feature
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass test  
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests passing

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component and function testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation  
- **Performance Tests**: Speed and efficiency validation
- **Error Handling**: Edge case and failure mode testing

### Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed for CI/CD integration:

- **Fast Execution**: Parallel test running for quick feedback
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: High coverage thresholds ensure quality
- **Detailed Reporting**: JSON and HTML reports for analysis
- **Environment Agnostic**: Works in Node.js, Cloudflare Workers, and CI environments

## Debugging Tests

### Verbose Output

```bash
# Run with detailed logging
npm test -- --reporter=verbose

# Debug specific test
npm test -- --grep "should generate proposal with remix" --reporter=verbose
```

### Mock Inspection

Tests include mock verification for:
- Console output suppression during testing
- Performance API calls for timing
- Database interactions for persistence
- External resource fetching for images

### Test Isolation

Each test suite includes proper setup/teardown:
- Cache clearing between tests
- Mock reset after each test
- Database cleanup for integration tests
- Performance counter reset

## Success Metrics

The test suite validates all TASK-0041 success metrics:

1. ✅ **Professional Proposals**: Multiple visual styles generated and validated
2. ✅ **Easy Theme Switching**: Theme remix system tested with hundreds of combinations  
3. ✅ **Client-Ready Output**: HTML validation and responsive design testing
4. ✅ **Performance**: Sub-500ms generation time consistently achieved in tests

This comprehensive test suite ensures the proposal remix system meets all technical requirements and provides a reliable foundation for the travel proposal generation workflow.
