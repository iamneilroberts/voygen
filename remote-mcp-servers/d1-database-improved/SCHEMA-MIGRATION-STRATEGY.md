# Schema Migration Strategy: Database Schema Mismatch Fix

## Problem Analysis

The Voygen travel management system had critical database schema mismatches that were causing failures in trip management operations:

### 1. Missing `trip_client_assignments` Table
- **Issue**: Code expected a normalized junction table for trip-client relationships
- **Reality**: Database only had denormalized JSON storage in `trips_v2.clients`
- **Impact**: `INSERT INTO trip_client_assignments` operations were failing with "table doesn't exist" errors

### 2. Schema Mismatch Between Code and Database
- **Code Expectation**: Relational normalized tables with foreign key relationships
- **Database Reality**: Denormalized JSON fields for embedded data storage
- **Conflict**: Code couldn't work with either approach consistently

### 3. Facts Dirty Constraint Violations
- **Issue**: `UNIQUE(trip_id, reason, created_at)` constraint too restrictive
- **Impact**: Legitimate updates happening in the same second were being rejected
- **Error**: `UNIQUE constraint failed: facts_dirty.trip_id, facts_dirty.reason, facts_dirty.created_at`

## Solution Overview: Dual-Write Strategy

The solution implements a **dual-write compatibility strategy** that supports BOTH normalized and denormalized approaches during the transition period.

### Core Principle
> Maintain data consistency across both the JSON fields (denormalized) AND the relational tables (normalized) simultaneously.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Migration SQL (`015_trip_client_assignments_table.sql`)

#### A. Created Missing Junction Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE trip_client_assignments (
    assignment_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    trip_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    client_email TEXT NOT NULL,
    client_role TEXT DEFAULT 'traveler',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (trip_id) REFERENCES trips_v2(trip_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (client_email) REFERENCES clients_v2(email) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE(trip_id, client_email, client_role)
);
```

#### B. Dual-Write Triggers
Automatically maintain JSON consistency when junction table changes:

```sql
-- Insert trigger: Add to JSON when added to junction table
CREATE TRIGGER trg_trip_client_assignments_insert
AFTER INSERT ON trip_client_assignments
BEGIN
    UPDATE trips_v2 SET clients = JSON_INSERT(clients, '$[#]', 
        JSON_OBJECT('email', NEW.client_email, 'role', NEW.client_role, 
                   'assigned_at', NEW.created_at))
    WHERE trip_id = NEW.trip_id;
END;

-- Delete trigger: Remove from JSON when removed from junction table
CREATE TRIGGER trg_trip_client_assignments_delete
AFTER DELETE ON trip_client_assignments
BEGIN
    UPDATE trips_v2 SET clients = (
        SELECT JSON_GROUP_ARRAY(value) FROM JSON_EACH(clients) 
        WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(value, '$.email') != OLD.client_email
    ) WHERE trip_id = OLD.trip_id;
END;
```

#### C. Fixed Facts Dirty Constraint Issue
- Recreated `facts_dirty` table with `INTEGER trip_id` (was TEXT)
- Modified constraint to use `ON CONFLICT IGNORE`
- Updated all triggers to use `INSERT OR IGNORE`

### 2. Code Changes (`trip-tools.ts`)

#### A. Dual-Write Client Assignment
The `assign_client` operation in `bulk_trip_operations` now:

1. **Inserts into junction table** (which triggers JSON update via trigger)
2. **Also directly updates JSON field** as backup for trigger failures
3. **Handles JSON parsing errors gracefully**
4. **Provides detailed success feedback**

```typescript
case 'assign_client':
  // 1. Insert into normalized junction table (triggers JSON update)
  const assignResult = await db.prepare(`
    INSERT OR REPLACE INTO trip_client_assignments (
      trip_id, client_email, client_role, created_at
    ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
  `).bind(trip.trip_id, operation.data?.email, operation.data?.role || 'traveler').run();

  // 2. Direct JSON update as backup
  const clientAssignment = {
    email: operation.data?.email,
    role: operation.data?.role || 'traveler',
    assigned_at: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  
  let clients = JSON.parse(currentTrip?.clients || '[]');
  clients = clients.filter(c => c.email !== operation.data?.email);
  clients.push(clientAssignment);
  
  await db.prepare(`UPDATE trips_v2 SET clients = ? WHERE trip_id = ?`)
    .bind(JSON.stringify(clients), trip.trip_id).run();
```

#### B. Enhanced Error Handling
- Graceful JSON parsing with fallback to empty array
- Detailed success messages indicating dual-write completion
- Proper error context for debugging

### 3. Compatibility Features

#### A. Unified View
Created `trip_client_relationships` view that shows assignments from BOTH sources:

```sql
CREATE VIEW trip_client_relationships AS
-- From junction table
SELECT trip_id, client_email, client_role, 'junction_table' as source
FROM trip_client_assignments
UNION ALL
-- From JSON field  
SELECT trip_id, JSON_EXTRACT(value, '$.email'), 'json_field' as source
FROM trips_v2, JSON_EACH(clients);
```

#### B. Migration Safety
- All operations use `INSERT OR REPLACE` or `INSERT OR IGNORE`
- Existing data is preserved and migrated appropriately
- Schema changes are backward-compatible

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Zero Downtime Migration**
- System continues working during transition
- No data loss or service interruption
- Gradual migration possible

### 2. **Backward Compatibility**
- Old code reading JSON fields continues working
- New code using junction table works immediately
- Both approaches stay synchronized

### 3. **Data Consistency**
- Triggers ensure JSON and junction table stay in sync
- Backup direct writes provide redundancy
- Comprehensive error handling prevents data corruption

### 4. **Future Flexibility**
- Can gradually migrate to fully normalized approach
- Can maintain denormalized approach if preferred
- Easy to extend with additional relationship types

## Testing and Validation

### Test Script (`test-schema-fix.sql`)
Comprehensive validation covering:
- Table structure verification
- Dual-write functionality testing
- Trigger behavior validation
- Constraint fix verification
- Cleanup procedures

### Key Test Cases
1. **Junction Table Insert** → Verify JSON updated automatically
2. **Direct JSON Update** → Verify both sources show data
3. **Constraint Violations** → Verify `INSERT OR IGNORE` works
4. **Bulk Operations** → Verify compatibility with existing workflows

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Migration**:
   ```bash
   # Apply the migration SQL
   wrangler d1 execute voygen-db --file=migrations/015_trip_client_assignments_table.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Code Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy updated MCP server
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Run Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Test the schema fix
   wrangler d1 execute voygen-db --file=test-schema-fix.sql
   ```

4. **Monitor**:
   - Check error logs for constraint violations (should be eliminated)
   - Verify trip-client assignments work properly
   - Monitor dual-write consistency

## Future Migration Path

### Phase 1: Dual-Write (Current)
- Both JSON and junction table maintained
- Maximum compatibility and safety

### Phase 2: Normalize Gradually
- Migrate application code to prefer junction table
- Keep JSON as read-only backup

### Phase 3: Full Normalization (Optional)
- Remove JSON fields if desired
- Maintain only normalized tables
- Update all queries to use junction table

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Junction table vs JSON field consistency
- Constraint violation reduction
- Operation success rates
- Query performance impact

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor trigger execution
- Validate data consistency between sources
- Clean up any orphaned records
- Update documentation as system evolves

This dual-write strategy ensures a smooth transition while maintaining system stability and data integrity throughout the migration process.
